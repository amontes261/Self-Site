# Welcome to My Website

### Created by Alex Montes

This project was made using ReactJS, HTML and CSS & is hosted via GitHub Pages. It's meant to show information about myself, information about my projects, and show what I'm capable of doing with ReactJS. Click [here](https://amontes261.github.io/#/) to access my currently-deployed site.

To make a site like mine, click [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to visit the React-App repository & get started. To learn more about React and/or learn how to program using the framework, check out the [documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

Feel free to reach out to me on Discord for any help or inquiriesâ€“ my handle is `@a.montes28#4501`.

## Commands I've Used

### `npm run start`
Starts running the application on your local machine in development mode.\
Clicking [here](http://localhost:3000) after running this command will open the locally-hosted runtime in your browser.\
*(The runtime is hosted on localhost port 3000)*

### `npm run deploy`

Builds & deploys the web-application to GitHub Pages.\
After your terminal reads *"Published"*, it takes GitHub approximately 4-8 minutes for deployed changes to be compiled & built under the hood once this command is ran.
