# Alex Montes' Website

This project is made using ReactJS, HTML and CSS, and is hosted via GitHub Pages. It's meant to show information about me, information about my projects, and show my capabilities with ReactJS. Click [here](https://amontes261.github.io/#/home) to access the site. To make your own site like this, click [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to get redirected to the React-App repository & get started. To learn more about React and/or learn how to program with the framework, check out their [documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

Feel free to reach out to me on Discord for any help or inquiriesâ€“ my handle is `@a.montes28#4501`.

## Commands I've Used

### `npm run start`
Starts running the application in development mode.\
Clicking [here](http://localhost:3000) will open the locally-hosted runtime in the browser.\
*(This is hosted under localhost @ port 3000)*

### `npm run deploy`

Builds & deploys the web-application to GitHub Pages.\
After your terminal reads *Published*, it takes GitHub approximately 4-8 minutes for deployed changes to be compiled & built under the hood once this command is ran.
